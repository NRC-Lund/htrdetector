# What is htrdetector?
This is an algorithm to detect the head-twitch response (HTR) or "wet dog shakes" in rodents using accelerometer signals. The HTR is commonly used in neuroscience research to investigate activation of the 5-HT2A receptor.

# Documentation
Please see the script [demo.m](https://github.com/NRC-Lund/htrdetector/blob/main/demo.m) for an example on how to use the detector. More information can be found in this [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.509527v1).

# Dependencies
The algorithm is written in Matlab. It requires the Signal Processing Toolbox.

# Installation
Make sure that the folder `+htrdetector` is on the Matlab path.
